//! Source validation and stream reading.
//!
//! A source directory is only trusted after its stream files survive the
//! checks the design contract demands: regular files, no symlinks, no extra
//! hard links, not world-writable, owned by the directory's user, not written
//! to recently, and a schema revision the migrator understands. Reading is
//! always `SQLite`-first with `JSONL` as explicit gap recovery, because the
//! two streams were an independent fail-open dual write in v1 (#6605).
//!
//! Validation and reading are bound to one object per file: every stream
//! file is opened once with `O_NOFOLLOW` and checked through the descriptor's
//! own `fstat`, `JSONL` recovery reads the held descriptor, and the `SQLite`
//! pass reads a private snapshot copied through it. `SQLite` resolves
//! pathnames itself at open time, so a path-based reopen would follow
//! whatever the (user-controlled) source directory holds by then; the
//! snapshot is the exact object that passed validation.
