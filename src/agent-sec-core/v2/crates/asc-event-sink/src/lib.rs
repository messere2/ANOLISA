//! Dual-write assembly for security and observability events.
//!
//! Daemons own explicitly configured sinks. Legacy process-global access remains
//! for security events only; observability uses [`ConfiguredObservabilitySinks`].
//! This layer reuses the existing writers and owns no persistence implementation.
//!
//! | Entry point | `JSONL` path | `SQLite` path | Reported to caller |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | [`log_event`] | swallows | swallows | never |
//! | [`ConfiguredObservabilitySinks::record`] | raises | raises | always |
//!
//! Hosts close configured sinks directly. [`shutdown_sinks`] closes only the
//! process-global security-event sink.
